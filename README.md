# Curios Media Hodler

[![Modrinth](https://badges.moddingx.org/modrinth/versions/curios-media-holder) ![Modrinth](https://badges.moddingx.org/modrinth/downloads/curios-media-holder)](https://modrinth.com/mod/curios-media-holder)

An addon of HexCasting, making media holder items able to go inside Curios/Trinket slots.  
Since base HexMod already had [Curios/Trinkets compat in 1.19](https://github.com/FallingColors/HexMod/blob/1.19/Forge/src/main/java/at/petrak/hexcasting/forge/interop/curios/CuriosApiInterop.java#L47), and [will have it in 1.20](https://github.com/FallingColors/HexMod/pull/996), this mod won't be published seriously - let's treat it as a temp solution in older 1.20 versions before my PR merged and published :3

## Functions

- Mixin'ed Curios/Trinket support for media holders
- Builtin tags for media vials (`hexcasting:battery`) and greater linker (`hex_ars_link:linker_great`) from Hex-Ars Linker
